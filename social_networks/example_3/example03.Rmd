# Working with centrality measures

In this example, we compare different centrality measures on the
Krackhardt friend and advice networks. 

### Load the necessary libraries
```{r C1, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```

### Load the Krackhardt data.
```{r C2}
```

### Look at summary data
```{r C3}
```

### Plot networks
```{r C4}
```

### Compare diameters
```{r C5}
```

### Compute centrality measures of the friend graph
```{r C6}
```

### Produce correlation plot
```{r C7, fig.height=3}
```

### Compute centrality measures of the advice graph
```{r C8}
```

### Produce correlation plot
```{r C9, fig.height=3}
```

### Compare in-degree distributions
Out-degree is less interesting.
```{r C10, fig.height=3}
```
